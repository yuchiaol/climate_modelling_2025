# Grey Radiation Model

## climlab
From now on, it would be useful, and sometimes helpful, to konw [climlab](https://climlab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), developed by Professor Brian E. J. Rose. Let's start with a few examples: [here](https://brian-rose.github.io/ClimateLaboratoryBook/courseware/grey-radiation-climlab.html). We will see how to construct a 30-layer model, which seems not feasible for solving the equations analytically.

(1-\alpha)Q + \sigma T_{a}^{4} = \sigma T_{s}^{4}
```

```{note}
back radiation: $\sigma T_{a}^{4}$
```
